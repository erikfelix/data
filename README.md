### Street Sweeping Sites Relative to Income

<b>Description:</b> there are two datasets, 1) the location of all the street sweeping locales in the City of LA, 2) demographics of City of LA by neighborhood councils. The locales of street sweeping in LA can be overlayed and juxtaposed with the median incomes of LA neighborhoods to glean if there is a relationship between the two. </br>
